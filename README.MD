This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Development How-To

UI Application communicates with next backends
- All /api/* requests are handled by API Server 
- All /service-catalog/* requests are handled by service catalog
- All /model/* requests are handled by Istio (istio-ingress in particular)

In production all required routing are managed by reverse-proxy server.

But in development after `npm start` your development server can handle only static files.
So that development server starts with a proxy middleware and plays role of reverse proxy by itself.
Proxy rules are described in `./src/setupProxy.js`. You should provide required backends 
according the rules in that file. If you have deployed ODAHU system in kubernetes cluster 
then simplest way to do that:
```shell
# Example for API Server
kubectl port-forward svc/odahu-flow-api 5000:80 -n odahu-flow
```
